Once a page exists and is uploaded to github please assign a "Non-Functional" flare to it.
Once all controllers, models and views were created for the page, flare it as "Ready for Functionality".
Once the page is fully functional with all the code being done, flare it as "Functional".
Functional pages will be reviewed to eliminate all errors, ensure everything works as expected and
  there are no cases which could break the page. Once reviewed, the page is to be flared as "Staged".
Staged pages, once all of the functionality of all the related pages if deemed Staged, are to be changed
  (at the same time) to Deployed. That marks an end for a closely-related set of pages.
