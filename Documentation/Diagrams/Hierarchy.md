# Page creation hierarchy

Assuming here's no developers, no games and no reviews and no comments then this is how you would add content:

First, a developer must be added.

From the details page of the developer you added you can add a game for that developer. The create page will have the ID of the developer passed to it and automatically applied.

From the details page of the game you added you can add a review for that game. The create page will have the ID of the game passed to it and automatically applied.

From the details page of the review you added you can add a comment for that review. The create page will have the ID of the review passed to it and automatically applied.
